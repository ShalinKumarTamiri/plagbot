 ## Objective :
 
    * This a bot to check how similar the files are.
    
    * We used python to develop this and also used the random , datetime ,string ,nltk packages.
    
    * Now , our main goal to check text documents only.
    
 ## Steps :
 
    1.Bot should greet the end user and asks for name of the end user
    
    2.Welcome the end user 
    
    3.Gives options to the end user to choose
    
    4.If he/she wants to perform plagiarism checks
    
    5.Then , it asks for file names which has to be checked
    
    6.It performs some operations and outputs how similar they are.
    
    7.Then , it aks for the input whether he/she wants perform again or wants exit
    
    8.Finally , it greets the end user and quits.
    
 ## Approach :
 
    1.We initially splits the sentences into words and remove all duplicate words 
    
    2.Then we will remove punctuations from the remaining words
    
    3.We will stem the filtered words 
    
    4.We will do this process for both the files
    
    5.We will find how many words are common in both filtered words and we will calculate how similar they are.
    
 ## Functions and their use :
 
    1.Greetings : To greet the end user
    
    2 Welcome : Welcomung the end user with name
